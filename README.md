# Json_Segmenation_for_Ontology
GitHub repository containing python code for segmenting Json-dictionaries and translates it into an ontological structure

This repository contains code for a special segementation method which subdevides json files representing nested python dictionaries into subfiles and transfere their content into a chosen Ontology.
A test-crawler and data miner for Ansys ".out-files" is also cantained. This tools converts out-files into a Json Representation of them.

Disclaimer, most of this code is currently under active development, not well documented in code as well as with a missing documentation. Most of these are in development and the code in refactoring, however, as the code is a one-person-project and furthermore developed by a not native programmer updates, modifications and cleaning might be required before it can be used by you. However i will still try to update and maintain it as best as possible, based on the interesst vissible on this repository. 

So in order to encurrage me in developing this code further i am very happy if you can just send me a message (e.g. E-mail), why you are interessted in using it and which requirements for implementing it in your ecosystem are currently not meet. Thank you in advance.

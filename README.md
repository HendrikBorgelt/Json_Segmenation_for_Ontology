This is a tool for segmenting nested JSON-dictionaries and convert them/their data into an Ontology.
It is intended to be used on JSON-dictionaries which are generated in a defined manner, as presented below.

</p>
<br>

As one can from the example in figure 1, concepts belonging to each other, and therefore colored in a similar color, are nested into each other in this JSON-file. A spliting into smaller segments can therefore be recommended in order to simplifie accesibility, findability and readability ad a JSON-file generated by e.g. Computational-Fluid-Dynamic Simulations might yield over 300 keywords representing settings.

    2) At the top is a stylised image of a nested JSON-Dictionary with special "concept" keywords which are used <br> to define junctions leading to other concepts. At the bottom a stylised image of an segmented JSON-Dictionary, <br> in which each concept is seperated into its on JSON-subdictionary, with links to <br> other dictionaries represented by a polygon with pale infile and a black dot in its centre </i>
